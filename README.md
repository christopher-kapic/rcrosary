> Who's going to save our Church? It's not our bishops, it's not our priests and it is not the religious. It is up to you, the people. You have the minds, the eyes and the ears to save the Church. Your mission is to see that the priests act like priests, your bishops act like bishops, and the religious act like religious. -Fulton Sheen

We have seen bishops seemingly try to abrogate the Traditional Latin Mass--at the very least, there has been an effort to minimize access to the Latin Mass. Sometimes, this includes ordering a priest not to celebrate Mass Ad Orientem, or even removing him from his parish.

If you are a layperson, then take the opportunity to publicly pray in Latin. Since you have not sworn a vow of obedience, a bishop cannot prevent you from praying in Latin, teaching others to pray in Latin, or teaching about the traditional understanding of morality.

I hope [RCRosary](https://rcrosary.org) proves to be a helpful tool for you in learning and teaching the Rosary in Latin.
